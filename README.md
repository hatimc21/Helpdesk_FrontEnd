- **Technology I use:**

The ticket system uses Vue Framework, Vue JS is a progressive Javascript framework for developing user interfaces. This framework bases its main core on the view layer with the model-view-controller pattern, allowing to relate the presentation layer with the logical layer of the project in an easy and efficient way.

**Before you start:**
If you have not configured the api it is recommended that you go here [Ticket System Api](https://github.com/Darknet17/ticket-system-api "").

**Installation:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
    
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Darknet17/ticket-system-app
```

 2.  **Execute:** 

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run serve
# or run the next command for production
$ npm run build
```

 3.  **Add your file** `.env` **:**

 ```bash
 $ cp .env.example .env
 ```

 4. **API entry point:**

add your entry point to connect to the api in the .env file

`VUE_APP_URL_API=http://webserver/api/v1/` <br>

**Docker:**

Now let's build the Docker image of our application: 

```bash
$ docker build -t ticket-system-app/dockerize-ticket-system-app .
```

Now let's build the Docker image of our application:

```bash
$ docker run -it -p 80:80/tcp --rm ticket-system-app/dockerize-ticket-system-app
```

**important**

After you have done the backend and frontend configuration, the user and password is :
`
email:admin@admin.com and password: admin1234
`
then if you want to change it, you log in and go to the employee part and change it to the one you like.
